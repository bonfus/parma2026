Superconductivity and Magnetism are among the most striking  successes of the quantum mechanical description of solids.

The workshop “Advances in Quantum Magnetism and Superconductivity” will bring together leading researchers and young scientists to discuss recent progress and emerging trends in the study of these phenomena in correlated electron systems.

Topics will include novel quantum magnetic materials, unconventional superconductivity, topological effects, and advanced experimental and theoretical approaches for exploring their fundamental properties. The meeting aims to foster scientific exchange and collaboration across different disciplines, providing a stimulating environment for sharing ideas and future perspectives in the rapidly evolving field of quantum materials.


The workshop will also offer an opportunity to celebrate the scientific career and contributions of Prof. Roberto De Renzi, whose work has significantly advanced the field of quantum magnetism and strongly correlated systems by using local probe investigation.

The workshop will be held in the [Auditorium "Centro Sant'Elisabetta"](santelisabetta) Parma, Italy, on the 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> of January 2026, starting at 14:30 on Thursday, and finishing early afternoon on Friday.


Scientific and organizing commettee: Giuseppe Allodi, Pietro Bonfà, Stefano Carretta, Luigi Cristofolini, Massimo Ghidini, Mauro Riccò, Samuele Sanna, Paolo Santini, Massimo Solzi.
