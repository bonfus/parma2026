There are **no registration fees**.

The registration is done by email and includes access to the workshop and coffee breaks.

The participants should, however, take care of their accommodation. There is a list of suggested Hotels in the [Travel and Accommodation](travel-and-accomodation) page.

The workshop includes invited and contributed talks.
